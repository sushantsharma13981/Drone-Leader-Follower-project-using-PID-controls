use pip install pybullet for simulation if pybullet is not installed.
To run the simulation run the following command in cmd prompt ---> python drone_follower.py
the key bindings are RDFG (to be used as WASD bindings) for X and Y movements of the drone. Use arrow keys for Z coordinates. Yaw is not implemeted as of now.
